# Mobile Responsiveness Plan for Landing Page

## Analysis of Current Issues

After analyzing the Landing.jsx file, I identified several mobile responsiveness issues:

### 1. Header/Navigation Issues
- Mobile menu button exists but lacks functionality
- Navigation links are hidden on mobile (`hidden md:flex`)
- Header padding and sizing may not be optimal for mobile

### 2. Hero Section Issues
- Typography scaling needs improvement for smaller screens
- Grid layout `grid lg:grid-cols-2` works but could be optimized
- Demo card aspect ratio might not work well on small screens
- Button layouts may stack poorly on mobile

### 3. Content Sections
- Features grid is responsive but could be improved
- CTA section text sizing needs mobile optimization
- Footer layout could be better for mobile

### 4. Modal Issues
- Connect wallet modal sizing for mobile devices
